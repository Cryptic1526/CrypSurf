Welcome to CrypSurf v1.<br>
This project is a simple proof of concept WIP browser like Google Chrome or Firefox, made in python. This project is made ontop of ProgrammingHero's browser using QyQt5 ([HERE](https://github.com/ProgrammingHero1/my_cool_browser)). I've simply built up from it and made it my own.

## ‚ùî Progress

This is still a very much in-dev project. Nothing is optimised, it is very likely to crash, and there are tonnes of bugs. I'll slowly chip away at it and eventually have a finished little app. Until then, check out the TODO section to see where I'm up to

## üìÉ TODO

- **Styles**: Style the UI so it looks actually decent (very much WIP)

- **Fix non-http domain conversion**: Converting queries like `example.com` into QUrls like `https://example.com` and not just giving it to the search engine

- **Optimisation**: Get lots of tabs to work without crashing the system, and other general optimisation like startup times.

There are way more TODOs, but those are the things I'm currently working on.
